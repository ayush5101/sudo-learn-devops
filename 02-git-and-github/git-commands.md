# 🚀 Git Commands - The Power Moves You Need to Know

Git is your best friend in the DevOps world.  
It helps you keep track of your code, collaborate with teams, and make sure you never lose a single line of work.  
Let's dive into the **power moves** you need to get started!

---

## 1. `git init`
> "Start a new Git project, fresh and ready to go."

```bash
git init
````

🌱 Think of it as planting a new tree. The project begins here!

---

## 2. `git clone`

> "Copy someone else's project so you can play with it."

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
```

👯 It's like getting a copy of your friend's homework, but with permission.

---

## 3. `git add .`

> "Add all changes to the staging area."

```bash
git add .
```

🚀 Ready to blast off? You're saying, "Hey Git, I’m ready to commit these changes."

---

## 4. `git commit -m "Your Message"`

> "Save your changes and leave a note about it."

```bash
git commit -m "Fix bug in login page"
```

📝 It’s like saying, “Here’s what I did, and here’s why I did it.”

---

## 5. `git status`

> "What's the current state of my project?"

```bash
git status
```

🔍 This command checks what files are ready to commit and which are still pending.

---

## 6. `git log`

> "Show me the history of all my commits."

```bash
git log
```

🕵️‍♂️ Track every change you’ve made, like a digital diary of your code life.

---

## 7. `git diff`

> "What exactly has changed in my files?"

```bash
git diff
```

👀 This is like comparing the before and after of a makeover. See what’s different!

---

## 8. `git branch`

> "List all the branches in my repo."

```bash
git branch
```

🌳 It’s like checking out the branches on a family tree of your code.

---

## 9. `git checkout <branch>`

> "Switch to another branch."

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
```

🔄 Change gears without messing up your main project.

---

## 10. `git checkout -b <branch>`

> "Create a new branch and switch to it immediately."

```bash
git checkout -b cool-feature
```

🎉 It’s like opening a new tab to work on something exciting.

---

## 11. `git merge <branch>`

> "Merge the changes from another branch into mine."

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

🔗 It's like combining two puzzle pieces into one beautiful picture.

---

## 12. `git pull`

> "Fetch changes from the remote repo and merge them."

```bash
git pull
```

⏬ Stay updated! Pull the latest changes from the repo so you're in sync with everyone.

---

## 13. `git push`

> "Send your local changes to the remote repo."

```bash
git push origin main
```

🚀 Upload your hard work to the cloud. Time to share your changes with the world.

---

## 14. `git remote add origin <url>`

> "Link your local repo to a remote GitHub repo."

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

🌍 This connects your project to the world. It's like building a bridge to GitHub.

---

## 15. `git fetch`

> "Get all the latest updates from the remote repo, without merging."

```bash
git fetch
```

🔄 Fetch updates but keep control. No surprises here, just knowledge.

---

## 16. `git reset`

> "Undo changes you’ve made, like nothing happened."

```bash
git reset --hard
```

🕳️ Hit the undo button on your last commit. Be careful though, it erases everything!

---

## 17. `git revert <commit>`

> "Undo a commit but keep it in the history."

```bash
git revert abc123
```

🔙 A safe undo. You cancel the bad commit but still leave a trace in the history.

---

## 18. `git rm`

> "Remove a file from your project and Git’s tracking."

```bash
git rm file.txt
```

🗑️ Say goodbye to that file and Git forgets about it too.

---

## 19. `git stash`

> "Temporarily store your changes and get back to a clean state."

```bash
git stash
```

📦 It’s like putting your work in a box, to come back to later.

---

## 20. `git cherry-pick <commit>`

> "Apply changes from a specific commit to your branch."

```bash
git cherry-pick abc123
```

🍒 Like picking your favorite part of someone else's work and adding it to yours.

---

## 21. `git rebase`

> "Reapply commits on top of another branch."

```bash
git rebase main
```

🛠️ A powerful way to clean up your commit history and integrate smoothly with others.

---

## 22. `git tag`

> "Label a specific point in history."

```bash
git tag v1.0
```

🏷️ It’s like putting a sticker on a specific commit to mark something important.
